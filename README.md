#A SIMPLE PTYHON PROGRAM TO TRACK STUDENT GRADES:

PURPOSE OF THE PROGRAM :
The program allows users to input grades for various subjects, calculate the average grade, determine the letter grade, 
and compute the GPA (Grade Point Average) based on predefined scales. This can help in managing and tracking student performance.

Key Features:
Input Grades: The program accepts input from the user for grades in different subjects.
Average Calculation: It calculates the average of all the grades entered.
Letter Grade: Based on the average, it determines the letter grade (A, B, C, etc.).
GPA Calculation: Based on the average, it computes the GPA (on a 9.0 scale, depending on your preference).

Program Flow:
The program starts by prompting the user to enter grades for different subjects.
Once the grades are entered, it calculates:
The average grade.
The letter grade (using the average).
The GPA (based on the average grade).
It then prints out the results: the average grade, the letter grade, and the GPA.

Example Workflow:
Step-by-Step Example:
User Inputs:

Math: 85
Physics: 90
Chemistry: 78
The Program:

Calculates the total sum of grades: 85 + 90 + 78 = 253
Calculates the number of subjects: 3
Calculates the average: 253 / 3 = 84.33
Based on the average:
Letter grade: B (since 84.33 is between 80 and 89)
GPA: 8.0 (for a 9.0 scale, as 84.33 is between 80 and 89)

Conclusion:
This program is set up to be interactive and useful for calculating and tracking the grades of students. 
It would compute the average grade, determine the letter grade, and calculate the GPA based on the grades submitted. 
You can easily customize the grading scale and tweak it to fit the school's educational system.
